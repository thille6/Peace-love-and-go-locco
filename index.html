                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>Peace, Love and Go Loco is a retro-inspired 2D platformer that combines classic side-scrolling mechanics with a modern, humorous twist. Players guide a laid-back hippie through colorful worlds filled with obstacles, hidden surprises, and a unique "trip system" where mushrooms transform the environment into dreamlike or darker variations. These magical mushrooms not only change the world around you but can also grant extra lives, adding a strategic element to exploration. The target audience is players aged 12 and above who enjoy playful platformers with a fresh, surreal identity. The unique selling point lies in its mix of nostalgia, humor, and dynamic level variations.</p>

                        <p>The goal of this project was to explore how UX design can enhance accessibility and engagement in a small-scale indie game. The case study aims to show how structured design methods, user testing, and visual identity contribute to a game that is simple to play but hard to put down.</p>

                        <p>The project was carried out in three weeks as a portfolio production using the Double Diamond process. We moved from discovery and definition of ideas to development and delivery of a prototype. The scope included creating a core concept, designing mechanics and rules, and prototyping an alpha version in Unreal Engine that could be tested by real players.</p>

We also carried out a competitor analysis of similar platformers such as Rayman Origins, Psychonauts, and Wario Land. Market trends revealed a demand for lighthearted, visually striking platformers that stand out in a crowded indie market. Feedback confirmed that humor and unexpected mechanics were strong points to emphasize.</p>

                        <p>Before building the prototype in Unreal Engine, we sketched out early wireframes in Figma to explore level layouts, character placement, and menu navigation. These low-fidelity sketches helped us visualize the player flow and identify potential issues before moving into development. A Crazy Eight workshop was also used to quickly generate multiple variations of how the game could look and feel.</p>

Players can easily navigate through menus and levels without instructions, thanks to a familiar control scheme and a clear visual flow. The trip-system introduces variety without overwhelming the player, making the game engaging while keeping controls simple.</p>

                        <p>Peace, Love and Go Loco was an opportunity to explore how UX methods can shape not only usability but also the playful identity of a game. From discovery workshops to an Unreal Engine prototype, the project demonstrates how structured design, iteration, and humor can create a unique and engaging platformer experience. For future projects, I would ensure even earlier user involvement and more structured accessibility features.</p>

                        <p>The visual identity draws on colorful 8-bit inspiration with a psychedelic twist. Dreamlike "good trip" worlds feature bright palettes and soft shapes, while "bad trip" variations create darker, more chaotic environments.

                        <p>We tested the prototype within the team and later with external users. Feedback highlighted issues such as unnatural gravity, mirrored character movement, and bugs with platforms. Despite these challenges, players consistently described the game as humorous and fun. Iterations were made to improve jumping mechanics and remove problematic features.</p>
                        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The game was designed to be easy to pick up, with straightforward controls and visual clarity. Even in early stages, the goal was to make it approachable for a wide audience by focusing on readability and inclusive design choices.</p>

                        <p>One of the biggest challenges was balancing simplicity with innovation. Players needed familiar mechanics to feel comfortable, while the trip-system added complexity. By iterating quickly and testing frequently, we refined the experience without losing accessibility. Removing unnecessary mechanics, like moving platforms that caused frustration, improved flow and enjoyment.</p>
                        <h3>Impact & Insights</h3>
                        <p>Player reactions during testing were positive, with laughter and curiosity being common responses. Most users said they would consider playing the game if released. The most important lesson was how valuable quick iteration and user feedback are in refining a fun yet usable game experience. Humor and visual identity proved to be strong motivators for engagement.</p>
